	\section*{Introduction}
	
	Humans can see if a video is running forward or backward, like in the following 3 images we can easily tell that it is backward.

	Following the article [1], I tried to implement an algorithm that tackle this problem.
	
	\section*{General structure of the algorithm}
	
		The first step is to compute descriptors, there are many ways to do this so I explain it in details in the next section.
		
		Then given these descriptors, we have to reduce the size of each video representation (there are many descriptors by video), so I run a k-means algorithm to get only the $K$ most used descriptors and I assign each descriptor to his closest descriptor computed by k-means. Then we can represent each video by a vector of size $K$ where at index $k$ there is the number of occurrences of descriptor $k$.
		
		In other words, we have constructed histograms that represent videos. Eventually I run an SVM classifier on these histograms (normalized). I used the barrier method to compute the SVM.
	
		\section*{Computation of descriptors}
		
		This is the main choice of the algorithm, as we have to compute descriptors that contains information about the arrow of time. For this I could have chosen to use pre-trained convolutionnal neural networks, but these networks were pre-trained for an other task which means they could have lost information about the arrow of time, or simply be not efficient.
		
		So I choose to compute motion descriptors based on optical flow, and then train my own CNN.  
		
		\subsection*{Motion descriptors based on optical flow}
		
		
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Assumes brightness constancy $f(x,y,t) = f(x+dx, y+dy, t+dt)$
			\item Assumes small motions $f(x+dx,y+dy,t+dt) = f(x,y,z) + \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}dx + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}dy + \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}dt$
		\end{itemize}
		
		\[u = u_{av} - fx\frac{fx u_{av} + fy v_{av} + ft}{\alpha + fx^2 + fy^2}\]
		\[v = v_{av} - fy\frac{fx u_{av} + fy v_{av} + ft}{\alpha + fx^2 + fy^2}\]

			Warp a coarse result in a finer image as an initialization
		
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Train a CNN on videos for classification, recognition or something else
		\item Use the descriptors computed by the trained CNN as motion descriptors
		\end{itemize}
		
		I implemented a 3D CNN toolbox based on DeepLearnToolbox by R. B. Palm (2D CNN)
		\newline
		
		Train a CNN on videos for seeing the arrow of time using a CNN structure used for segmentation
		\newline
		
		Train a CNN on videos for seeing if the sequence of frames is in a possible order or not
		
		\section{Results}
		
			The optical flow method gives around 50\% of errors
			\newline
			
			The CNN cannot be trained properly in a reasonable amount of time.
